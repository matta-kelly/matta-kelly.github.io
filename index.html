    <p>This is my sister and I on a family surf trip to Costa rica. I love this picture because it captures both of our personalities
      while the symetry clearly shows that we are one in the same

    <p> My journey from here has been a whirl wind filled with...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ups</li>
      <li>downs</li>
      <li>and getting turned all the way around</li>
    </ul>

    <p> This has resulted in me developing a compass of sorts, principles which are important to remeber.
      In order they are...
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Presence</li>
      <li>Loving Kindness</li>
      <li>And a whitsfull but novel approach to daily life</li>
    </ol>

    <p> As all thing, they are surely to evolve as the world spins</p>
